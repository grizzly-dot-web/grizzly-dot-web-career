# [career.grizzly.web](http://career.grizzlydotweb.com) 
It is a website to show my life career for companies who are interested in me.
If you come from there, be welcome. Look around, to see my style to code.

## Development
- `npm install`
- `npm run watch`
- `npm run watch:server`
- 
## Production
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run start`

## Info
This website is developed with React and ExpressJS
My backend code can be found under `src/backend`, the frontend part is found here `src/ts/frontend`.

# Originally reason for this project
Originally I used this project to create an [CCMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_content_management_system) based on:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the client side. 
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/de/) on the Server side.

The development for the CCMS moved to the branch `rewrite_atomicCCMS`.

_Don't Panic it's my Playground, it's in experimental state_

Soon as possible it will be shipped under **[atomicCCMS](https://github.com/grizzlydotweb/atomicCCMS)**
