# [career.grizzly.web](http://career.grizzlydotweb.com) 
It is a website to show my life career for companies who are interested in me.
If you come from there, be welcome. Look around, to see my style to code.

_Don't Panic it's my Playground, 
it's in experimental state_

I use this project to create an [CCMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_content_management_system) based on:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the client side. 
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/de/) on the Server side.

At the moment my backend code can be found under `src/backend`, the frontend part is found here `src/ts/frontend`.

As soon as possible they will be merged to one source.
Only the build job will split them into two seperate files, one for the client and one for the server.

And it will be shipped under **[atimoicCCMS](https://github.com/grizzlydotweb/atomicCCMS)**
